Create Your Own Virtual Machine: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough of Arch Linux Installation
<br> <br>
**Introduction**

This document outlines the process of installing and configuring Arch Linux on macOS using VirtualBox virtualization software.
The goal was to perform a complete installation of Arch Linux manually, from setting up the virtual environment to enabling a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI).
The system was also customized to include SSH, Zsh with color support, and other essential command-line enhancements.

1. Virtual Machine Preparation

The setup began with preparing a virtual environment in VirtualBox.
VirtualBox was downloaded and installed from the official Oracle website, and the Archboot AARCH64 ISO was obtained from the Archboot repository, as it supports ARM-based Macs. Here is the link where you can install the Unofficial ARM-based Arch: https://release.archboot.com/aarch64/latest/iso/ 

Once installed, a new virtual machine was created with the following configuration:

Operating System: Linux (ARM 64-bit)

Memory (RAM): 8 GB

CPU Cores: 10

Disk Storage: 20 GB (Virtual Disk Image)

Boot Mode: UEFI

The Archboot ISO file was mounted, and the VM was started to launch the Arch Linux installer.
